# The New JavaScript Ain't Like My Old JavaScript
My experience with JavaScript in 2018 is quite different from how I learned it in the late 90s.  A lot has changed in 20 years, and this folder intends to capture a whole host of exericses used to bring me up-to-date with the times.  

This folder contains exercises from various JavaScript learning resources:
* [A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html)
* [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
* [Testing JavaScript with Kent C. Dodds](https://testingjavascript.com/)
