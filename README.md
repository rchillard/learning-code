# Learning to Code
This is my return to code.  I took programming and computer science in secondary school, back in the late 90s/early 00s, and I have dabbled in it for years, but now I feel the need to get serious again.  

## Problem
I have discovered that in the intervening time period the world of web development has passed me by.  I am a dinosaur in the programming world, and it's time to fix that.  I want to solve hard technical problems on my own.  I want to learn a modern language, how web development happens today, and what all has changed in the last 15-20 years.  

## Solution
This repository is my solution to tracking that problem.  On the top level, you'll see folders for individual languages, core technologies, libraries, frameworks, and even wider, more categorical areas (e.g. serverless).  

This repository is here for me, as my reference, and as part of my quest to learn in public and be unafraid of that.  If you want to follow more of my musings and how these projects relate, check out [my blog](https://rchillard.com/).
